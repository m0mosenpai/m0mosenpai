### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Electronics student interested in Software Development, Design and Information Security. I hope to one day be able to write code I'm proud of. <br>
I'm currently exploring Open Source and working on improving my Algorithmic and Design Patterns knowledge.

I also game in my free time. Find me on Discord @m0mosenpai#2268. <br>
